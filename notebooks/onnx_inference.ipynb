This eagerness is enhanced if the pattern departs from randomness in the specific direction of being symmetrical.   \n","30695                                                                                            The love of Christ for me will get last say. He is merciful to me for his name’s sake, for the sake of his own goodness, for the sake of his steadfast love and compassion (Psalm 25).

My indestructible hope is that he has turned his face towards me, and he will never turn away.   \n","35935                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Leaders should lead as if they were born for leadership and nothing else because effective leadership leads to magnificent results.   \n","1502                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Man is certainly stark mad; he cannot make a worm, and yet he will be making gods by dozens.   \n","15558                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  [I would] rather discover one cause than gain the kingdom of Persia.   \n","38090                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     A reservoir of strength exists deep within me, waiting to be tapped when life's challenges arise.   \n","29564                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              If you search for God you will find him and He will not give up on you\".   \n","\n","                                                                                                                                                                                                                            quote_info_list  \\\n","20685                                                                                                                                                                                                             ['time', 'William Blake']   \n","26304                                                                                                                                                                                                     ['science', 'Mehmet Murat ildan']   \n","21011                                                                                                                                                                                    ['ptsd', 'time', 'trauma', 'Lois McMaster Bujold']   \n","23820                                                                                                                                                                                                                ['love', 'bell hooks']   \n","25025                                                                                                                                                                  ['abstraction', 'art', 'paintings', 'science', 'Wassily Kandinsky ']   \n","35731                              ['gift-gugu-mona-book-club', 'gift-gugu-mona-library', 'gift-gugu-mona-masterclass', 'gift-gugu-mona-philosophy', 'leader', 'learn-quotes', 'life', 'life-lessons', 'words-of-wisdom', 'Gift Gugu Mona']   \n","19641                                                                                                                             ['depression', 'grief', 'life', 'loss', 'memory', 'pain', 'sadness', 'spiritual', 'time', 'Claire North']   \n","16525                                                                                                                                                                                      ['man', 'selfish', 'truth', 'William J Federer']   \n","28627                                                                                                                                                                                               ['god', 'prayer', 'Gordon B.
